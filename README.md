# Hangman--Game-in-Python
This project implements a console-based Hangman game using Python. A random word is selected, and the player guesses one letter at a time with a limited number of attempts. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce attempts and display parts of the hangman until the player wins or loses.
